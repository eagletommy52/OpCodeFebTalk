# OpCodeFebTalk
Demos for Feb OpCode Talk @ Conde

Also showed code from cnlohr's [channel 3 project](https://github.com/cnlohr/channel3) (check his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CNLohr) this guy is wicked smart!)

The demo'd SoC load balancer used the [ClusterHAT](https://clusterhat.com/) which is available for purchase for about $37 as well as a custom designed mount/LED holder I designed for this demo--the model is availble in the repo if you'd like to print yourself.  The LED's used were [10mm size from ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/20pcs-DC-9-12V-3mm-5mm-8mm-10mm-LED-Light-Emitting-Diodes-Pre-Wired-20CM-Line/122003901596?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=421005444723&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649) 

If you live near a [Microcenter](com/site/stores/default.aspx) in the US, you should always stop in whenever you get a chance and buy a raspberry pi zero w for $5 as you can only buy one at a time, but the price point for a wifi/hdmi/usb/linux capables machine is hard to beat!
